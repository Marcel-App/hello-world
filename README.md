# hello-world
Hi Everyone!
Marcel-App,it's a privilege having me here into this wonderful platform.
GitHub is a codehost platform for version and collaboration and it does not require any form of coding. All you need in this wonderful platform is to create a repository which is used to organise a simple project.
